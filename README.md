# Carter Rabasa (he/him)

## UPDATE (1/2/2023)

After a long post-Twilio sabbatical, I'm jumping back into serving developers! If you're building developer tools and are looking for a Marketing, DevRel or Product leader, let's talk.

## tl;dr

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Carter Rabasa and I'm a builder. I've been building products and businesses my entire life, starting with a Doom clone I wrote as a teenager on my [TI-85](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-85). I started my tech career as a software engineer but quickly moved through product marketing, developer relations and product management roles. All along the way, I've built [businesses](https://dcfray.com), [communities](https://2022.cascadiajs.com/) and [products](https://fizbuz.com/). The common thread across all of these things: I love software, I love building things and I love serving communities.

The highlight of my career was working at [Twilio](https://twilio.com) where I got to help build one of the first and finest developer relations programs in the world. Our mission was to inspire and equip developers to build new and amazing communications experiences. We defined Twilio's developer GTM in the early years and helped build trust and affinity between Twilio and developers.
  
Based on my experiences talking to hundreds of developers about Twilio, I moved over to Product with the goal of making it easier, faster and safer for developers to ship Twilio application. I founded the Dev Tools team and along with a small team of engineers shipped a suite of serverless and debugging tools for developers before stepping away after the company's IPO.

Lately, I have spent my time running the [SeattleJS](https://seattlejs.com) meetup, organizing the [CascadiaJS](https://2022.cascadiajs.com) conference and building [200 OK](https://200ok.vc), an angel investor group that focuses on the dev tools space.

I am based in Seattle, WA and am married to [Carrie Rabasa](https://carrie.rabasa.com/). We have two [awesome](https://www.geekwire.com/2018/will-8-year-old-girl-stick-coding-fun-project-dad-attracts-gifts-tech-community/) [kiddos](https://bit.ly/girl_scout_cookies_emily) and a beloved Labradoodle named Otto.

## Career

I've worn a lot of hats in my career, but the common threads have always been technology, community and a desire to learn. I am constantly building things.

## Community

I've been organizing communities my entire adult life, everything from kickball leagues to software meetups to angel investor groups. I get my energy from being around people, helping them and creating fun. The last 10 years I've run the CascadiaJS conference, which has helped thousands of developers find jobs, build their networks and uplevel their skills.

- Have run the [SeattleJS](https://seattlejs.com) meetup on and off since 2012.
- Started a co-working space for developers (now closed).
- Helped organize the first [Sports Hack Day](https://www.geekwire.com/2013/sports-hack-day-diary-lessons-learned-journalist-hackathon/) in Seattle.
- Organize the annual CascadiaJS conference (see [2022 event](https://2022.cascadiajs.com)).


## Writing

At Twilio, I learned about the importance and value of storytelling. Giving developers great documentation is just the start, the next step is to inspire them to imagine what new things they can build.

## Talks

I've only given a handful of public talks in my career, but they were all about topics near and dear to my heart. I actually prefer to support other speakers, which is one of the reasons I love organizing meetups and conferences.

## Angel Investments

I dove into angel investing in 2019, and never looked back. As a person who lives and breaths programming, I decided to specialize in developer tools and developer-adjacent startups doing interesting things in community and hiring.

- [Fission](https://fission.codes/) - identity, data, and compute for dweb
- [Abbot](https://ab.bot/) - chat ops platform
- [Begin](https://begin.com) - build and deploy platform for functional web apps on AWS
- [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com/) - coding competitions and community
- [Major League Hacking](https://mlh.io/) - largest student hackathon league in the world
- [YData](https://ydata.ai/) - data quality platform
- [Codiga](https://www.codiga.io/) - code analysis
- [Autocode](https://autocode.com/) - platform for webhooks, bots and APIs

## Software I've Written

I'm more of a hacker than a software engineer, but here are a few things that were pretty cool when I built them.

- [A profile builder for devs](http://fizbuz.com)
- [SMS voting with real-time results](https://github.com/crtr0/votr-part5)
- [Convert videos into animated gifs](https://github.com/crtr0/gifit)

## Misc

- I was featured on the front page of the Wall Street Journal in full pointillistic glory in 2005 ([pdf](https://github.com/crtr0/crtr0/blob/main/wsj-kickball.pdf))
