# 👋 Hi, I’m Carter Rabasa!
🏳️‍🌈 Pronouns: he/him

I've been writing code in the mid-90's when I built a Doom clone on my TI-85.

I've worn the following hats in my career: web developer, software consultant, entrepreneur, Product Marketer, Developer Evangelist, Product Manager, event organizer and angel investor.

Following a sabbatical, I'm back in the market for a new job! Open to leadership roles in Marketing, Developer Relations and VC.
