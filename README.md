# Carter Rabasa (he/him)

## UPDATE 

After a long post-Twilio sabbatical, I'm jumping back into startups! If you're looking for a Marketing or Developer Relations leader, let's talk.

## tl;dr

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Carter and I'm based in Seattle, WA. I am [married](https://carrie.rabasa.com/), the lucky Dad of two awesome kiddos, very active in the developer and startup communities here in the Pacific Nortwest and love to work and invest in the devtools space.

I've been writing code since I was a teenager when I built a Doom clone on my TI-85. I've worn a lot of hats in the tech industry, doing everything from web development to consulting to product management.

The highlight of my career was working at [Twilio](https://twilio.com) where I got to help build one of the first and finest developer relations programs in the world. Our mission was to serve developers, and how we went about this task was instrumental to Twilio's success. I later moved over to Product and shipped a suite of serverless and debugging tools for developers before stepping away after the IPO.

Lately, I have spent my time running the [SeattleJS](https://seattlejs.com) meetup, organizing the [CascadiaJS](https://2022.cascadiajs.com) conference and investing in dev tools startups via [200 OK](https://200ok.vc).
