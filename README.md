## UPDATE 

After a long post-Twilio sabbatical, I'm jumping back into startups! If you're looking for a Marketing or Developer Relations leader, let's talk.

## tl;dr

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I am a life-long programmer and have been writing code since I was a teenager who built a Doom clone on my TI-85. True story, a bully took my calculator away from me and took the batteries out, deleting the program. I've had a "no assholes" policy ever since.

I'm based in Seattle, WA and am the lucky Dad of two awesome kiddos. I write code every day, am very active in the developer and startup communities in Seattle and love to build and invest in developer tools.

The highlight of my time in tech was working at [Twilio](https://twilio.com) where I got to help build one of the first and finest developer relations programs in the world. Our mission was to serve developers, and how we went about this task was instrumental to Twilio's success. I later moved over to Product and shipped a suite of serverless and debugging tools for developers before stepping away after the IPO.

Lately, I have spent my time advising startups, running the [SeattleJS](https://seattlejs.com) meetup, organizing the [CascadiaJS](https://2022.cascadiajs.com) conference and investing in dev tools startups via [200 OK](https://200ok.vc).
